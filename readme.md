# Excalibur TypeScript & Vite template

Check out the full documentation @ https://excaliburjs.com

You can use the excalibur cli to generate this template

## Concept

* You are a miner digging down an infinitely generated ground for gems, jewels, gold, treasure, etc
  * Perhaps loot is generated more frequently the deeper you dig enhancing the risk/reward trade-off
  * Perhapse monsters are more dangerous the deeper you go
* You are trying to avoid various monsters, critters, etc that if they touch you you drop your collection
  * You can take x many hits before you die
  * Think sonic with flashing invincibility frames
* Your loot is only safe when you reach the surface (or maybe other checkpoints)

### Stretch Goals
* Rewards for collecting: Upgrade you speed, pick, mining, defense, etc
* 

```sh
npm create excalibur
```
